ExtendedDictionary exposes the standard functionality of a [Scripting.Dictionary object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/dictionary-object) as well as providing additional useful functionality that avoids boilerplate.

* Load range of values as key / value pairs for fast dictionary population.
* Better control over what does and does not raise an error.
* Option to count the keys rather than load values.
* Wrapper to get value or default similar to modern languages.
